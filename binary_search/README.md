# Description
This is an implementation of the famous binnary search algorithm.
This algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the list has already been sorted
The first index of your list would be the low mark whiles the last index would be 
the high mark. You want to loop as long as the low is less than or equal to the 
high value. Feel free and play with it. I hope that you learn something from it

## Usage
To play the game, you need to modify the binary_search.rb file 
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:tawrahim/Ruby_Games.git
$ vim binary_search.rb
$ modify where the method is invoked and viola! you are enjoying some binary
$ ruby 
```
