# Description
“99 Bottles of Beer” is an American folk song, with rather lengthy and tedious lyrics. The song's simple lyrics are as follows:

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take 1 down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take 1 down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
Take 1 down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.

…
…

2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
Take 1 down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take 1 down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

Not often do people sing the whole song, as it takes about 30 long boring minutes! But computers are good at repetitive tasks and we will make Ruby write out the lyrics to this song! In fact, this programming exercise is frequently coded in almost every language and you can find such examples on the internet. This project was originated from learnstreet. As usaul I hope upu learn something new from playing with the program
