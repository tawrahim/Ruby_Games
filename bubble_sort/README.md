# Description
This is an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. It is not the most efficient way to search through a list but its a good way to search a list.

## Usage
I hope you can also learn a bit from looking at the code
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:tawrahim/Ruby_Games.git
$ cd Ruby_Game/bubble_sort
//Modify the array on line 24 with different values
$ vim bubble_sort.rb
$ ruby bubble_sort.rb
```
