# About
The code in this repository are problems that I find online and solve. All the solutions are
written in ruby. The idea behind this project is to practice as much ruby as I can so that I dont
end up forgetting what I have learnt. The motivation of this project is from [Joshua Cheek's] (http://github.com/JoshCheek/Play)
play repository.

## Philosophy
* code with ruby
* test with rspec
* document with Yardoc
* If you repeat yourself more than three times, there is a better way to do it. refactor!
* push code to github every night
* Repeat
