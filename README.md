# Concentration Project
On my free time, I love to write code so these are some baby projects that
I wrote in ruby. I figured the best way to learn Ruby was to create things
you love so that is why I am here.

## Installation
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:tawrahim/Ruby_Games.git
```

## Games
* **Concentration** => It is a simple board game that checks to see if the two values selected match. No fancy gui or anything. straight up command line!
* **Conversion** => Converts temprature from one given unit to the other
* **BankTeller** => Some object oriented programming concepts explored, Withdraw money and add money to a bank

## Philosophy
* code with ruby
* test with rspec
* document with Yardoc
* If you repeat yourself more than three times, there is a better way to do it. refactor!
* push code to github every night
* Repeat
