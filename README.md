# Concentration Project
This is my solution to a project that I found on learnstreet 
It is just a basic puzzle game that tests 'Arrays, loops, methods and Objects

## Installation
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:tawrahim/memory.git
$ cd concentration
$ ruby concentration.rb
```

## Philosophy
* code with ruby
* test with rspec
* document with RDoc
* If you repeat yourself more than three times, there is a better way to do it. refactor!
* push code to github every night
* Repeat
