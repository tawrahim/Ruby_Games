# About
The code in this repository are problems that I find online and solve. All the solutions are
written in ruby. The idea behind this project is to practice as much ruby as I can so that I dont
end up forgetting what I have learnt. The motivation of this project if from [Joshua Cheek's] (http://github.com/JoshCheek) 
play repository whereby he created a bunch of projects. 


## Installation
If you feel like trying it out, feel free and clone the project
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:tawrahim/Ruby_Games.git
```

## Games
* **Concentration** => It is a simple board game that checks to see if the two values selected match. No fancy gui or anything. straight up command line!
* **Conversion** => Converts temprature from one given unit to the other
* **BankTeller** => Some object oriented programming concepts explored, Withdraw money and add money to a bank

## Philosophy
* code with ruby
* test with rspec
* document with Yardoc
* If you repeat yourself more than three times, there is a better way to do it. refactor!
* push code to github every night
* Repeat
